# Python
A collaboration of my own Python work. Most of this is from me when I was a beginner at Python and I was still learning but some of it could help a lot of people!

All files will have a (example) bracket at the end that will state the version of script it was created in.
Files available in this repo:
    A basic Python/Tkinter GUI thats easily customisable. (3.x)
    Hangman (3.x)
    Website Tool (3.x)
